DjangoCloud deploys your Django project to AWS with one command. You skip the Dockerfiles, load balancers, certificates and server setup, and keep every release saved so you can roll back.

```bash
pip install djangocloud-cli
djangocloud login
djangocloud deploy
```

The CLI is [`djangocloud-cli` on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/djangocloud-cli/). Nothing to change in your project. Your static files, HTTPS and database migrations are taken care of.

## Where to start

* **New here?** Follow the [Quickstart](getting-started/quickstart/).
* **Curious how your app is run?** Read [How your app is run](how-it-works/how-your-app-runs/): uvicorn or gunicorn, static files, health checks and what we add to your settings.
* **Want deploys on every push?** [Connect GitHub](getting-started/github/).
* **Wondering what is and isn't supported?** Read the [known limitations](reference/limitations/) before you build on it.
* **What does it cost?** See [Pricing](reference/pricing/).
* **Stuck?** Come to [Slack](community-and-support/support/).

:::note
DjangoCloud is in early access. Some features are still being finished, and the pages say so where it matters.
