Each deployment runs on one or more identical **instances**. You choose the size of an instance and how many you run.

## Sizes

| Size | vCPU | RAM |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nano | 0.25 (shared) | 512 MB |
| Micro | 0.25 (shared) | 1 GB |
| Small | 0.5 (shared) | 1 GB |
| Medium | 1 | 2 GB |
| Large | 2 | 4 GB |
| XLarge | 4 | 8 GB |

Prices are on the [Pricing](../../reference/pricing/) page.

## Changing size or instance count

Open your deployment, go to **Settings**, and choose a size and a number of instances between **1 and 20**. The change is recorded straight away and then applied to the running service in the background, so you don't need to deploy again. On a hosted plan the new size is billed first. If applying it fails, the deployment keeps its current size and the reason is shown.

### From the command line

```bash
djangocloud scale                          # pick a size from a list, then the number of instances
djangocloud scale --size small --instances 3
```

The CLI shows the old and the new size with the monthly price, asks to confirm (`-y` skips that), and then waits until the change is applied. `--no-wait` returns as soon as it is queued, and `djangocloud status` shows the size at any time. Leave out `--size` or `--instances` to keep the current value of that one. Both are limited to the sizes above and 1 to 20 instances, and only one change can run at a time. In [CI](../../getting-started/ci/) give both flags, with `--no-input` in front: `djangocloud --no-input scale --size small --instances 3 -y`. See the [CLI reference](../../reference/cli/) for the flags.

### Autoscaling

Autoscaling adds and removes instances for you, between a minimum and a maximum you choose.

```bash
djangocloud autoscale on --min 2 --max 6
djangocloud autoscale off          # keeps the range for next time
djangocloud autoscale              # show it
```

You can also set it under **Settings** in the dashboard. It is deliberately slow and careful:

* **Out:** one more instance when the CPU averaged over 5 minutes is above 70% (or memory above 85%), at most every 5 minutes.
* **In:** one fewer instance when the CPU stayed below 30% for the whole last 30 minutes, and the remaining instances would still sit under 60% carrying the same load, at most every 15 minutes.
* It never goes outside your minimum and maximum, and never while a size change is already running.
* It reads the same samples as the [Metrics](../logs-and-metrics/) tab, which arrive every few minutes, so it reacts in minutes, not seconds.

If a scaling change fails, for example because a card is declined, autoscaling switches itself **off** and says why, instead of retrying and billing in a loop.

## Usage alerts

We email you when your app's CPU or memory stays high, and optionally when the server stops answering.

```bash
djangocloud alerts on --cpu 80 --memory 85 --downtime
djangocloud alerts off
djangocloud alerts                 # show the settings
```

* The **average over the last 10 minutes** has to be over your limit, so one busy minute is not an alert.
* You get one email when it starts, a reminder at most every 6 hours while it lasts, and the alert resets once usage is back under the limits.
* With `--downtime` you are also emailed when the server stops answering.

On Starter, AWS bills you for the servers directly in your own AWS account. DjangoCloud does not charge for them.

## Choosing a size

* Start with **Nano** for a small app or a test.
* uvicorn (or gunicorn, for a WSGI-only app) runs a fixed number of workers (default 2, set with `workers` in the [build settings](../build-settings/)). Each worker uses memory, so a memory-hungry app needs a bigger size or fewer workers.
* If a release keeps restarting or being killed, it may be running out of memory. Try the next size up.

## More than one instance

Instances don't share a filesystem or memory. Sessions, caches and uploaded files have to live outside the container. See [Persistent files and the ephemeral container](../ephemeral-container/).
